## üéØ **Project Overview & Understanding Questions**

### **1. Project Scope & Purpose**

- **Q**: "What problem does your Give Hope system solve, and why did you choose this particular project?"
- **A**: Our system addresses the challenge of making charitable giving accessible, transparent, and efficient. We chose this because it combines real-world impact with comprehensive technical implementation, demonstrating full-stack development skills while solving a meaningful social problem.

- **Q**: "Who is your target audience, and how did you validate the need for this system?"
- **A**: Our target audience includes donors, nonprofit organizations, and beneficiaries. We validated the need through research on donation inefficiencies, lack of transparency in charitable giving, and the growing demand for digital donation platforms.

### **2. Technology Stack Justification**

- **Q**: "Why did you choose Next.js over other frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue?"
- **A**: Next.js provides server-side rendering, API routes, and excellent developer experience. It's perfect for our use case because it combines React's component model with built-in backend capabilities, making it ideal for full-stack applications like ours.

- **Q**: "Why Prisma ORM instead of raw SQL or other ORMs like Sequelize?"
- **A**: Prisma offers type safety, excellent database schema management, and automatic migrations. It integrates seamlessly with TypeScript and provides a clean API for database operations, reducing development time and potential errors.

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture Questions**

### **3. System Design & Architecture**

- **Q**: "Walk me through your system architecture. Why did you design it this way?"
- **A**: We implemented a modern full-stack architecture with Next.js App Router, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL. The frontend uses React with TypeScript for type safety, while the backend uses Next.js API routes for serverless functions. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

- **Q**: "How does your authentication system work, and what security measures did you implement?"
- **A**: We implemented JWT-based authentication with access tokens (15-min expiry) and refresh tokens (7-day expiry). Security measures include password hashing with bcrypt, token validation, input sanitization, and secure session management. The system automatically refreshes tokens and handles logout securely.

### **4. Database Design**

- **Q**: "Explain your database schema design. Why did you structure it this way?"
- **A**: Our schema includes User, UserSettings, Cause, Donation, and Payment models. We normalized the database to prevent data redundancy while maintaining referential integrity. The UserSettings table stores refresh tokens separately for security, and we use proper relationships to track donations and their impact.

- **Q**: "How did you handle database relationships and what considerations did you make?"
- **A**: We used Prisma's relationship features to establish one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. We considered data integrity, query performance, and scalability. For example, donations are linked to both users and causes, allowing us to track individual contributions and overall project funding.

## üíª **Implementation & Code Quality Questions**

### **5. Frontend Development**

- **Q**: "How did you ensure your application is responsive and accessible?"
- **A**: We used Tailwind CSS for responsive design with mobile-first approach. We implemented proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation. The design adapts to different screen sizes and maintains usability across devices.

- **Q**: "Explain your component architecture. How did you make components reusable?"
- **A**: We created modular, reusable components following React best practices. Components like Navigation, Footer, and UI elements are designed to be configurable and reusable. We used TypeScript interfaces to ensure proper prop validation and maintainability.

### **6. Backend & API Development**

- **Q**: "How did you design your API endpoints, and what REST principles did you follow?"
- **A**: We followed REST conventions with proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), meaningful URLs, and consistent response formats. Our API includes authentication, user management, donation processing, and admin functions, all properly documented and following REST principles.

- **Q**: "How did you handle error handling and validation in your API?"
- **A**: We implemented comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes, meaningful error messages, and input validation. We use try-catch blocks, validate request data, and return consistent error responses. For sensitive operations, we added additional security checks.

## üîê **Security & Authentication Questions**

### **7. Security Implementation**

- **Q**: "What security vulnerabilities did you consider, and how did you address them?"
- **A**: We addressed SQL injection (using Prisma ORM), XSS attacks (input sanitization), CSRF attacks (built-in Next.js protection), and authentication bypass (JWT validation). We also implemented rate limiting considerations and secure password storage.

- **Q**: "How secure is your payment system, and what measures did you take?"
- **A**: We integrated with Paystack, a PCI DSS compliant payment processor. We never store sensitive payment data, use secure API calls, and implement proper transaction validation. All payment flows are encrypted and follow industry security standards.

### **8. Data Protection**

- **Q**: "How do you protect user data and ensure privacy compliance?"
- **A**: We implement data encryption, secure authentication, and proper access controls. User passwords are hashed, personal information is protected, and we follow data minimization principles. We also provide user control over their data and transparent privacy policies.

## üì± **User Experience & Testing Questions**

### **9. User Experience Design**

- **Q**: "How did you approach the user experience design, and what user research did you conduct?"
- **A**: We designed with user-centered principles, focusing on intuitive navigation, clear information hierarchy, and accessible design. We considered donor workflows, admin management needs, and mobile usability. The interface prioritizes clarity and ease of use.

- **Q**: "What accessibility features did you implement?"
- **A**: We implemented semantic HTML, proper heading structure, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast compliance. The application is usable by people with disabilities and follows WCAG guidelines for web accessibility.

### **10. Testing & Quality Assurance**

- **Q**: "How did you test your application, and what testing strategies did you use?"
- **A**: We conducted manual testing across different browsers and devices, tested user flows, and validated all features. We implemented error handling testing, security testing, and performance testing. Our testing strategy ensured the application works correctly in various scenarios.

## üöÄ **Performance & Scalability Questions**

### **11. Performance Optimization**

- **Q**: "How did you optimize your application for performance?"
- **A**: We implemented Next.js optimizations like dynamic imports, code splitting, and static generation where possible. We optimized database queries, used efficient data structures, and implemented proper caching strategies. The application loads quickly and provides smooth user experience.

- **Q**: "What performance metrics did you consider, and how did you measure them?"
- **A**: We focused on page load times, API response times, and database query performance. We used Next.js built-in performance tools and optimized based on Lighthouse scores. Our goal was sub-2-second page loads and sub-500ms API responses.

### **12. Scalability Considerations**

- **Q**: "How would your system scale to handle more users and donations?"
- **A**: Our architecture supports horizontal scaling through Next.js API routes and database optimization. We can implement caching layers, load balancing, and database sharding. The modular design allows for easy scaling of individual components.
